# kulup
An Open Source door lock

Kulup is 'lock' in Marathi.  This project implements an electronic door lock
controller for solenoid based door locks that unlock using a single 12V/1A DC
signal.

## Source Layout

The sources are laid out in various directories as follows:

- 'hw' has all the hardware designs
- 'firmware' has firmware for various supported boards with instructions to
  build them
- 'gateway' has the programs that run on an IoT gateway device (a fancy term
  for the raspberry pi you have lying around!) to service unlock requests.
